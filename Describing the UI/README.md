# Describing the UI

React is a JavaScript library for rendering user interfaces (UI). UI is built from small units like buttons, text, and images.

React lets you combine them into reusable, nestable components. From websites to phone apps, everything on the screen can be broken down into components.

React applications are built from isolated pieces of UI called components. A React component is a JavaScript function that you can sprinkle with markup. Components can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page.
